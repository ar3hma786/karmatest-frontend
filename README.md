# Admin Console Frontend for Managing Sales

This template provides a minimal setup for building an admin console frontend to manage sales using React and Vite. It includes hot module replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules for a better development experience.

Currently, two official plugins are available for integrating React:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ar3hma786/karmatest-frontend.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

bash
Copy code
cd your-repo-name

3. **Install dependencies:**

Run the following command to install all necessary packages:

bash

npm install
or if you prefer using Yarn:

4. **Start the development server:**

To start the local development server with hot module replacement, run:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
or with Yarn:

5. **Open your browser:**

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to see the admin console in action.
